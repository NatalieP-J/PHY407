- IMPORT Gaussian quadrature weights and points routine
- SET constants: volume is 1000 cubic centimetres, number density if 6.022e10^28 per metre cubed, the Debye temperature is 428 K, number of integration points is 50
- DEFINE Gaussian quadrature routine
- DEFINE a function that returns the integrand in the equation for Cv for a given x value
- DEFINE a function that returns Cv for a given temperature T 
	- SET the leading term for given T
	- EVALUATE the integral of the integrand function from 0 to Debye temp over temperature using Gaussian quadrature
	- RETURN the leading constant multiplied by the integral
- CREATE an array of temperature from 5 to 500 Kelvin
- FIND Cv for each temperature in this array
- PLOT Cv vs temperature
