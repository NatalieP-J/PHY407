- SET constants for program, phi = pi/4, h = 30000 for forward or backward method and h = 60000
- DEFINE a function to return the intensity given arrays of dw/dx and dw/dy
- READ in altitude.txt with numpy loadtxt as a 2D array
- INITIALIZE two arrays the same size as altitude.txt but full of zeros
- LOOP through the rows of the array
	- LOOP through each row 
		- IF the x value is at the start of a row, use forward difference
		- IF the x value is at the end of a row, use backward difference
		- ELSE use central difference
		- ADD result to the array holding dw/dx values
- TRANSPOSE the array and do the same looping for y
- PLOT the intensity for the calculated dw/dx and dw/dy arrays
