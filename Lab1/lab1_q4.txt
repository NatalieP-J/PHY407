DEFINE gravitational constant in units of AU, Msun and years (39.5 AU^3 Msun^-1, year^-1).
DEFINE initial time, final time and timestep.
CREATE sampled array of time based on the above criteria.
SET dependent variable arrays (x,y position and velocity as well as total separation r) to be an array of zeros as long as the sampled array of time.
SET initial positions and velocities in x and y.
FOR values in time array:
	- CALCULATE v_x,i+1 and v_y,i+1
	- CALCULATE x_i+1, y_i+1
	- CALCULATE r_i+1
PLOT y vs x, x vs t and y vs t
