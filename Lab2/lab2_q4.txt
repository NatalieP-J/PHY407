- SET slit separation to 20 microns, number of slits to 10, wavelength to 500 nanometres, screen width to 10 cm and focal length to 1 m
- CALCULATE total width of grating with (number of slits)*(slit separation)
- CALCULATE alpha using alpha = pi/(slit separation)
- DEFINE the transmission function q(u) to return (sin(alpha*u))^2
- DEFINE intensity integrand to be exp(i*2*pi*x*u/(wavelength*focal length)) times the square root of q(u)
- CREATE an array of x values
- FOR each x value:
	- CALCULATE intensity using Simpson's rule
		- SET upper and lower bounds of the integral
		- CHOOSE a number of steps
		- CALCULATE the width of each subdivision
		- SET the sum equal to intensity of the lower limit plus intensity of the upper limit
		- FOR k = 0 up to the total number of subdivisions
			- ADD to the sum 4 times the intensity of (lower limit + k*width) for odd k
			- ADD to the sum 2 times the intensity of (lower limit + k*width) for even k
		- MULTIPLY the final sum by (1./3)*width
	- CALCULATE intensity by finding the absolute value of the integral and squaring
- PLOT intensity vs x
