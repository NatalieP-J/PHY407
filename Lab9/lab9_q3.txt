SET constants for the program: m = 9.109e-31 kg, L = 1e-8 m, x0 = L/2, sig = 1e=10 m, kap = 5e10 m^-1, hbar = 1.055e-34 m^2 kg/s
SET boundary conditions psi = 0 at x = 0 and x = L
SET initial conditions psi(x,0)
SET number of slices N = 1000
DEFINE a function to return the real part of psi for given alpha and eta ks using idst
       (construct coefficient as in the part b) formula, then do an inverse transform)
SPLIT the initial conditions into two arrays, real and imaginary parts
PERFORM DST on each array to find alpha ks and eta ks respectively
SET an arbitrary time t
