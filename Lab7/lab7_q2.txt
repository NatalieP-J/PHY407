SET constants a = 1, b = 3
DEFINE function that returns [dx/dt,dy/dt]
DEFINE function that does B.S. method up to nmax, and it target accuracy is not reached, calls itself on subdivided interval
SET initial conditions x = y = 0
SET accuracy delta = 1e-10
SET interval from t = 0, t = 20
SET nmax = 8
SET initial interval size H = 20 and target accuracy delta*H
CALL B.S. function for given constants
PLOT x vs t and y vs t and put dots where the boundaries of the time intervals are.
